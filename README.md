# EnterprisePro module introduction
This is the repository that your team will be using to share everything project-related (source code, meeting minutes, documentation et al).
A basic directory structure is provided for your convenience. It is recommended that you do not stray from this structure unless absolutely necessary.

Allowed formats for all text documents: .doc/.docx/.pdf/.tex/.odt.

Please do not upload archives of your project contents, as this may have a negative impact on your marking

# Directory structure
* Documentation/: Any technical documentation relating to your project.
* Software/: The source code for your software solution should be under this directory.
* Minutes/: Your group's meeting minutes.
